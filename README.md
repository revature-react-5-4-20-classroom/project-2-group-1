# Fav Films
Fav Films is a basic web application for users to discover movies. Users can register and login to our web app to create a list of movies. User can deside which movies to add and which movies to remove. Don't want your list anymore? Delete it! Want to see someone else's list? Well go to the movies tab and peruse.  Want to find out more about the movies? Just click on the movie poster to be taken to the movie page. We will save all userlists for longer than you will probably use our application! Now that is data persistence in action!

### Motivation For This Application
We, The Contributors, are currently going through a rigorous training ran by Revature. Our cohort is focused on web development, and we are rapidly learning plenty of technologies. We needed to showcase everything that we learned for a project, and we decided something with movies would be great. Who doesn't like movies?
